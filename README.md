# Flood Mapping through Satellite Imagery in North Korea


## Project Description
</br>
This project studies the potential of satellite imagery and Relative Elevation Model (REM) in assessing and preventing flood events in North Korea. North Korea has been long exposed to natural disasters, including floods, which have caused significant damage to the country's infrastructure and agriculture. However, exposure to natural disasters is not the sole problem they are facing. The nation's barren landscape of digital information and the lack of transparency have made it difficult to assess the extent of the damage caused by these disasters. 

As such, this project aims to develop a framework that leverages satellite imagery to map and prevent flood events in North Korea. For a model to be a generalizable and accessible solution, we will use open-source data and tools like google earth engine and QGIS. The main challenge of using such public data will be spatio-temporal resolution. However, we will try to overcome this limitation by using a combination of different satellite imagery sources and REM data.

We expect that the results of this project will provide first responders in disaster relief with a tool to assess the extent of the damage caused by floods and help policymakers in such data-scarce regions to make informed decisions in disaster prevention and management.
